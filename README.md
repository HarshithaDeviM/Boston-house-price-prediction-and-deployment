# Boston-house-price-prediction-and-deployment
We conducted Boston house price predictions leveraging twelve regression models. Our implementation was deployed using Flask and hosted on the AWS Cloud platform.

## Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for the project.

Flask (Web Framework): Used to build the web application.

scikit-learn (Machine Learning Library): Utilized for implementing machine learning models for price prediction.

HTML/CSS (Frontend): Responsible for creating the user interface.

AWS Cloud: The project is hosted on the AWS cloud.
## Features
Input Fields: Users can input key features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, etc.

Prediction: The system predicts the median housing cost based on the provided input.

User-Friendly Interface: The web interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.

## How the Website Works
Enter Information:

 Visit the website and Enter the required information in the input fields.

Click "Predict":

After entering the necessary details, click the "Predict" button.

View Prediction:

The system processes the input using machine learning models.

The predicted median housing cost is displayed on the interface.
